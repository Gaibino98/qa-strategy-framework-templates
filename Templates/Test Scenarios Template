Test Scenarios - Login Functionality
✅ Happy Path (Valid Cases)
Correct credentials: Login with valid username + password.

Enter key submission: Submit the form by pressing Enter.

Trimmed whitespace: Login with spaces before/after credentials (should ignore spaces).

Case sensitivity: Test mixed-case usernames/passwords (if applicable).

Session reset: Reopen the login modal and verify fields are cleared.

Close button: Click "Close" or "X" to dismiss the modal.

Password masking: Ensure password field hides input (****).

Alphanumeric input: Fields accept letters + numbers.

Keyboard navigation: Tab/Enter works between fields.

Mobile UI: Layout adapts to small screens.

❌ Error Handling (Invalid Cases)
Empty fields: Submit with both fields blank.

Missing username: Fill only password.

Missing password: Fill only username.

Wrong credentials: Enter invalid username/password (check error message).

Script injection: Attempt XSS in username/password fields.

Special characters: Input <>[]%& (should sanitize or reject).

Long strings: Exceed character limits (e.g., 255+ chars).

Spaces-only: Enter only spaces in fields.

Offline mode: Try login without internet.

Rate limiting: Multiple failed attempts (lockout after 3-5 tries?).
